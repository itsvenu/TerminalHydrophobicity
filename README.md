#### TerminalHydrophobicity
Terminal hydrophobicity of a sequence is one of the important parameter for 
determining whether a protein underwent cotranslational(CT) folding or not. 
Hydrophobic start of a sequence favours the CT folding of a protein, meaning 
N-terminal of a protein should contain more hydrophobic residues than the C-terminal.
If the N-terminal is more hydrophobic than C, then there is a high probability of that
protein containing regions folded contarnslationally.
